# Distributed-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
This project implements a multi-agent architecture for autonomous vehicles using Deep Reinforcement Learning in CARLA Simulator. Through a centralized server that coordinates this continuous learning architecture, it is possible to extract and process the knowledge acquired by each agent during its learning process. This strategy facilitated transfer learning, allowing vehicles not only to learn from their own experiences but also from the experiences of other agents in diverse environments.
