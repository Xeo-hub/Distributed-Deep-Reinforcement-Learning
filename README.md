# Distributed-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
This project implements a multi-agent architecture for autonomous vehicles using Deep Reinforcement Learning in CARLA Simulator. Through a centralized server that coordinates this continuous learning architecture, it is possible to extract and process the knowledge acquired by each agent during its learning process.
